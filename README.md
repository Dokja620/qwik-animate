## Installation üëÄ
Install QwikAnimate in your project using npm:

```sh
cd my-project

npm install @dokja620/qwik-animate
```

## Usage Example
Here's a basic example to get you started with QwikAnimate:

### Example Usage in a component
In the Qwik component where you want to use the `Animate` component, import it and use it as shown below:

```tsx
import { Animate } from "~/components/qwik-animate/animate";

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      <Animate class="div" animationKeys="@supports_anim_chains">
        <!-- Your content here -->
      </Animate>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Run Once
The `runOnce` prop ensures that the animation runs only once when the element first comes into view.

```tsx
<Animate class="div" animationKeys="@supports_anim_chains" runOnce>
  <!-- Your content here -->
</Animate>
```

### Debug Mode
The `debug` prop allows you to enable console logs for debugging purposes.

```tsx
<Animate class="div" animationKeys="@supports_anim_chains" debug>
  <!-- Your content here -->
</Animate>
```

### Threshold Control
The `threshold` prop allows you to customize when animations start and stop based on the scroll position. The threshold values can be adjusted to control the intersection ratio for showing and hiding the animation.
In short:
`threshold`="`show threshold`, `hide threshold`"

```tsx
<Animate class="div" animationKeys="fadeIn" threshold="0.3, 0.7">
  <!-- Your content here -->
</Animate>
```
